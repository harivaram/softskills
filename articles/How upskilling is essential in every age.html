    <h1>How upskilling is essential in every age</h1>
    <h4>Learning that is experiential an combines real-worl knowledge and research enables us to have a strong grounding in whatever skill we set out to learn, writes Rajesh Panda</h4>
    <p>
     In  January 2020, the World Economic Forum announced that the world is facing an upskilling emergency. We live in a fast paced age. From the turn of the 21st century, as applied learning gained prominance, the need has emerged to be hands-on with the skills. About billion people need upskilling by 2030 across all ages.
    </p>
    <p>The underlying message for schools, organizations, governments and the society is to work together towards bringing in a learning environment that is agile and enables people to live a good life and contribute at the workplace.</p>
    <h4>Why upskilling at all</h4>
    <p>
      As the world becomes our university, 'learning how to learn' is the need of the hour - focussed on contineous reskilling. In this age of contineous discruption, individuals, teams and organizations are required to prepare for a super-learning future, centered on upskilling. These are the reasons for disrption:
      <ul>
        <li>Change in nature of work due to technological innovation.</li>
        <li>Rising demand for new compentencies.</li>
        <li>Altering employee expectations in the organization</li>
        <li>Changing labour demographics</li>
        <li>Delivery strategies</li>
        <li>Evolving business environment with its regulatory changes</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Reskilling and upskilling are the answers to these problems, however, the problem extends beyond the workplace. The challenge lies in the ability to learn, cope up with their fast-changing demands at the workplace.
    </p>

    <h4>Science of learning</h4>
    <p>Learning has four stages - know, practice, perform and reflect. However skilling focusses on two of these - practice and perfrom. The more you practice and perform, the better you are at texecuting a particular job with perfection.</p>

    <h4>Learn by doing</h4>
    <p>It is essential that whatever we know is practised and perfromed well so that it gets ingrained into our psyche and we can turn to that skill whenever the job at hand demands it.</p>
    <p>This form of learning is also called the 'learning-by-doing' model, which is a key driver to upskilling across all ages. The user learns from one's experiences and applies theoretical knowledge in real-world to generate tangible outcomes.</p>
    <p>This includes learn by applying trail-and-error learning, discovery versus instruction, experiential learning, practical experience versus bookish leaning and practice-theory practice dialectic.</p>

    <h4>How to learn</h4>
    <p>As children, we learn how to manage self because our learning happens in the real-world through our five senses - touch, smell, see, hear and feel. We imbibe the information from our surroundings using our senses and then understand what is what.</p>
    <p>As we move to the formance classroom, learning is restricted to books and instruction. The yardstick of our performance suddenly changes from real-world to performance in the classroom. The skill-gap starts here. We struggle in managing self, family and work (at school).
     This continues in universities and well into adulthood. We do not have the skills to manage in realworld - self, family, team or tasks work etc.
    </p>
    <p>An approach that combines experiential, hands-on learning with real-world knowledge and research will enable us to have a strong grounding in whatever skill we set out to learn. Learning and upskilling is a lifelong process and one should reflect on what and how to skill up and stay relavent in the dynamic workpalces.
